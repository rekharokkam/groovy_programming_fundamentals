I installed groovy through homebrew - lookup on google.

groovy environment manager - gvm - this tool helps to manage multiple versions of Groovy.
I didn't install it as I currently do not have need for multiple versions of groovy. This tool helps manage multiple versions of other languages as well -
Griffon, Gradle, JBake, etc ... This tool also helps install any of these languages.
This tool can be installed from the site - gvmtool.net



Groovy generates the bytecodes and runs on JVM

groovyc - tool for compiling - javac is the analogy
groovy - for executing - java is the analogy

Groovy comes with 2 default editors
1) groovysh - groovy shell. Execute groovysh and enter into the shell to execute commands.
Once in the shell execute Groovy Commands. Commands I excuted are -

1 + 1
println "Hello, World!"
void sayHello (String name) - When I hit enter groovy understood that the program is incomplete and changed the next line number to 001
println "hello ${name}"
}
name = "Dolly"
sayHello (name)

Type anything like Sys and press "tab" for auto suggestions.

You can use Java classes inside of groovy script -
One other way of running groovy script is - groovy -e "<CODE>" Ex - groovy -e "println InetAddress.localHost"

There are 2 ways to run a groovy file
a) a groovy script can be run by just executing groovy <complete name of the groovy script > EX - groovy hello_world.groovy OR groovy hello_world
In both cases byte code generated is not stored.

b) generating the byte code to execute -  groovyc hello_world.groovy - will generate a .class file.
This .class file can be executed as groovy hello_world
The same byte code can be executed using java as well - java -cp .:/usr/local/Cellar/groovy/2.4.15/libexec/lib/* hello_world
It is important to add the groovy libs in the classpath as java doesn't identify main class without these lib available in the classpath

2) grovyConsole - a nice GUI for executing the groovy code. PS - when using this tool make sure you check the option "Auto Clear output on Run".
This option helps in clearing the console.


Asserts, imports and def
------------------------
Using assert in Groovy helps do the assertions in a very elegant way. It is very widely used in unit testing.

In Groovy default imports are
    java.lang.*
    java.util.*
    java.net.*
    java.io.*
    java.math.BigInteger
    java.math.BigDecimal
    groovy.lang.*
    groovy.util.*


There are 2 ways to define the data type of a variable - "def" and [int, String, long, float, ...]
"def" is used when the data type of the variable is not known. static type is used when the data type of the variable is known ahead.
"def" does dynamic data type binding at the Runtime.

Ex -
def x = 1
println x.getClass().getName()

x = 'abc'
println '\n' + x.getClass().getName()

x = new Date()
println '\n' + x.getClass().getName()

Using assert with static data type

int x = 1
assert x.getClass () == java.lang.Integer


Integer and Floating Point Types
--------------------------------
In groovy while they support the same keywords as java everything is an Object.
Ex -
3.getClass().getName() - returns java.lang.Integer
2343435353453453453.getClass().getName() - returns java.lang.Long
2343435386787656675765675753453453453.getClass().getName() - returns java.math.BigInteger
(3.5).getClass().getName() - returns - java.math.BigDecimal

All the mathematical calculations in groovy are done at the BigDecimal level

Its better to do all the calculations at the BigDecimal level -
Ex - 2.0d - 1.1d - results in 0.8999999999999999 which is not very accurate
The same if done at the BigDecimal level - 2.0 - 1.1 = 0.9 - more precise and more accurate

In groovy 3/5 results in 0.6
In java 3/5 results in 0


Operator overloading
--------------------
look for methods on the Number class from gdk documentation - it has methods like plus, minus, power, multiply which are missing from JDK library.
look at the operator overloading page - http://groovy-lang.org/operators.html

Groovy Truth - Ex -
String str = "one"
def result = str ? 'Found' : 'not found'

Operator overloading exists throughout the groovy library


String and Groovy String
------------------------

def s = 'this is a string'
println 'single quote : ' + s.getClass().getName() - java.lang.String

s = "this is a string"
println 'Double quote : ' + s.getClass().getName() - java.lang.String

s = "this is a string with a twist : ${1 + 1}"
println "an evalator : $s : " + s.getClass().getName() - org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.GStringImpl

an expression is allowed only inside of a string with double quotes. Once a variable is placed inside of a double quoted string then it becomes a GStringImpl

can use +, -, ** on strings as well

Operator Overloading
--------------------

def s = 'this is a string'
s + ' and more' - this is a string and more
s - 'is' - 'is' - th  a string

single plus or minus removes only the first occurrence.

def s = 'abc'
s * 3 - here abc is repeated 3 times and then assigned to s - 'abcabcabc'

getAt Operator Overriding
-------------------------
def s = 'this is a string'
s[1] - h
s[-1] - g
s[-3] - i
s[0..3] - this
s[-1..-3] - gni
s[-3..-1] - ing
s[0..3, 5..6, 8, 10..-1] - thisisastring

multi line capabilities
-----------------------
curly braces is required only if some manipulation is needed. If just a variable is used then curly braces is not required.

String fname ='Graeme'
String lname = 'Rocher'
assert "$fname $lname" == 'Graeme Rocher'

String lname = 'Rocher'
println "$lname".getClass().getName() - org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.GStringImpl

def picard = '''
oh the vaccuum outside if endless
Unforgiving, cold, and friendless
But still we must boldly go
Make it so, make it so, make it so!
'''

println picard.readLines() - [, oh the vaccuum outside if endless, Unforgiving, cold, and friendless, But still we must boldly go , Make it so, make it so, make it so!]
println picard.readLines().size() - 5

Adding a blackslash tells groovy NOT to consider the line break

def picard = '''\
oh the vaccuum outside if endless\
Unforgiving, cold, and friendless\
But still we must boldly go\
Make it so, make it so, make it so!\
'''

println picard.readLines().size() - 1

Double quotes multi line strings

def saying = """
There are ${Integer.toBinaryString(2)} kinds of people in the world
Those who know binary, and those who don't
"""

println saying.readLines().size() - 3

forward slash is the delimiter for RE

def zip = ~/\d{5}(-\d{4})?/
println zip.getClass().getName() - java.util.regex.Matcher

def zip = /\d{5}(-\d{4})?/
println zip.getClass().getName() - java.lang.String - without the tilda

assert '12345' ==~ zip
assert '12345-1234' ==~ zip

=~ - returns java.util.regex.Matcher object, ==~ - exact match and return boolean that indicates if there was a match or not

assert '12345 12345-1234 1234'.findAll(zip) == ['12345', '12345-1234']
this findAll method makes sure it selects all the parts of the given string that matches the pattern.

In groovy, every operator overloading  invokes a method. Ex s + ' add more' - string.plus (' add more')
In case of == .equals() method is invoked in a null safe way.

/w - in RE means a text character - a-zA-Z0-9_
/W - means non text character

def testString = 'Flee to me, remote elf!'.toLowerCase().replaceAll (/\W/, '')
assert testString == 'fleetomeremoteelf'
assert testString == testString.reverse()
