I installed groovy through homebrew - lookup on google.

groovy environment manager - gvm - this tool helps to manage multiple versions of Groovy.
I didn't install it as I currently do not have need for multiple versions of groovy. This tool helps manage multiple versions of other languages as well -
Griffon, Gradle, JBake, etc ... This tool also helps install any of these languages.
This tool can be installed from the site - gvmtool.net
